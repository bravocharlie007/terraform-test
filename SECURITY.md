# Security Review & Recommendations - Gaming PC Infrastructure

## üéÆ Gaming PC Specific Security Considerations

### Multi-User Access Challenge
**The Problem**: Need to allow family members access to gaming PC without knowing their dynamic IP addresses.

**Current Risk**: Wide-open security groups (`0.0.0.0/0`) expose gaming infrastructure to entire internet.

### Gaming-Specific Security Solutions

#### Option 1: VPN Gateway (Recommended)
```hcl
# Deploy AWS Client VPN or OpenVPN server
resource "aws_ec2_client_vpn_endpoint" "gaming_vpn" {
  client_cidr_block      = "10.1.0.0/16"
  server_certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.vpn_server.arn
  
  authentication_options {
    type               = "certificate-authentication"
    root_certificate_chain_arn = aws_acm_certificate.vpn_client.arn
  }
}
```
**Benefits**: 
- Only VPN port exposed to internet
- Private access to gaming PC once connected
- Can manage user certificates for family members

#### Option 2: AWS Systems Manager + Remote Desktop
```hcl
# Remove SSH entirely, use Session Manager + RDP/VNC
# No open ports needed for management
resource "aws_instance" "gaming_pc" {
  # ... existing config ...
  iam_instance_profile = aws_iam_instance_profile.ssm_instance_profile.name
}
```
**Benefits**:
- No SSH ports exposed
- Access through AWS console
- Can use Remote Desktop for gaming sessions

#### Option 3: Dynamic IP Registration Service
```python
# Simple web service to register user IPs temporarily
# Update security groups with time-limited access (24h)
def register_user_ip(user_id, current_ip):
    # Add IP to security group with expiration tag
    # Automated cleanup removes expired IPs
```

## üö® Critical Security Concerns

### Immediate Action Required

#### 1. Exposed Credentials & Account Information
- **AWS Account ID exposed**: `191805346255` is hardcoded in `variables.tf`
- **Profile names exposed**: SSO profile "CharlesIC" is in plain text
- **Risk**: Account enumeration, targeted attacks

#### 2. Gaming-Inappropriate Instance Configuration
```hcl
instance_type = "t3.micro"  # Too small for gaming
ami_id = "ami-0557a15b87f6559cf"  # Amazon Linux, gaming may need Windows
```
- **T3.micro**: Insufficient CPU/memory for gaming workloads
- **Amazon Linux**: Most games require Windows
- **No GPU**: Gaming typically requires GPU instances (g4dn, g5, etc.)
- **Risk**: Poor gaming performance, potential crashes

#### 3. Wide-Open Network Access
```hcl
# Multiple security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 access
cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # HTTP, HTTPS, SSH all open to internet
```
- **SSH (port 22)**: Open to entire internet with password auth enabled
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: While expected for web services, lacks rate limiting
- **Risk**: Brute force attacks, unauthorized access

#### 4. Insecure SSH Configuration
In `user_data/userdata.ssh`:
```bash
sed -i 's/^PasswordAuthentication no/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
- **Enables password authentication** for SSH
- **No key-based authentication configured**
- **Risk**: Brute force attacks, credential stuffing

### High Priority Issues

#### 4. Unencrypted Communications
- **No HTTPS termination** at ALB level
- **No SSL certificates** configured
- **HTTP only** listener configured
- **Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception

#### 5. Missing Encryption at Rest
- **EBS volumes**: No encryption specified
- **CloudWatch logs**: No KMS encryption configured
- **SSM parameters**: Using default encryption
- **Risk**: Data exposure in case of AWS account compromise

#### 6. Overprivileged IAM Configuration
- **CloudWatch logger role**: Not defined in this configuration
- **EC2 instance profile**: Not specified, likely using default
- **Risk**: Privilege escalation, unauthorized AWS API access

### Medium Priority Issues

#### 7. Deprecated and Insecure Configurations
- **AWS provider v4.0.0**: Released in 2022, missing security updates
- **aws_alb resource**: Deprecated, should use aws_lb
- **No VPC endpoints**: All traffic goes through internet gateway

#### 8. Incomplete Security Logging
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Only 30-day retention
- **No GuardDuty**: Missing threat detection
- **No Config**: No compliance monitoring
- **No CloudTrail**: Missing in this configuration (may exist elsewhere)

#### 9. Single Points of Failure
- **Single EC2 instance**: No redundancy
- **Single AZ deployment**: Despite multi-AZ subnets, instance is in one AZ
- **No auto-recovery**: No health checks or auto-healing

## üõ°Ô∏è Gaming-Specific Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions for Gaming Use Case

1. **Upgrade Instance Type for Gaming**
   ```hcl
   # For gaming workloads, consider:
   instance_type = "g4dn.xlarge"  # GPU instance for gaming
   # or
   instance_type = "c5.2xlarge"   # High-performance CPU for CPU-intensive games
   ```

2. **Use Appropriate Gaming OS**
   ```hcl
   # For Windows gaming:
   # Use Windows Server AMI or create custom gaming image
   ami_id = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"  # Windows Server 2022
   ```

3. **Implement Gaming-Specific Security**
   ```hcl
   # Example: VPN-only access
   resource "aws_security_group" "gaming_vpn_only" {
     ingress {
       from_port   = 3389  # RDP for Windows
       to_port     = 3389
       protocol    = "tcp"
       cidr_blocks = ["10.1.0.0/16"]  # VPN subnet only
     }
     
     # Game-specific ports (example for Steam)
     ingress {
       from_port   = 27015
       to_port     = 27030
       protocol    = "tcp"
       cidr_blocks = ["10.1.0.0/16"]  # VPN only
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Family Access Management**
   ```bash
   # Option A: Generate VPN certificates for each family member
   # Option B: Shared VPN with individual user accounts
   # Option C: Time-limited IP registration system
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è General Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove Hardcoded Credentials**
   ```hcl
   # Instead of hardcoded values, use:
   variable "aws_account_id" {
     type        = string
     description = "AWS Account ID"
     # No default value - force explicit setting
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Least-Privilege Security Groups**
   ```hcl
   # Example: Restrict SSH to specific IPs
   ingress {
     from_port   = 22
     to_port     = 22
     protocol    = "tcp"
     cidr_blocks = ["YOUR_OFFICE_IP/32"]  # Not 0.0.0.0/0
   }
   ```

3. **Use Systems Manager Session Manager**
   ```hcl
   # Remove SSH access entirely, use SSM instead
   # No need for port 22 ingress rules
   ```

4. **Enable HTTPS with SSL Certificates**
   ```hcl
   resource "aws_lb_listener" "https" {
     load_balancer_arn = aws_lb.ec2_deployer_alb.arn
     port              = "443"
     protocol          = "HTTPS"
     ssl_policy        = "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
     certificate_arn   = aws_acm_certificate.cert.arn
   }
   ```

### Architecture Improvements

5. **Implement Defense in Depth**
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF) on ALB
   - VPC endpoints for AWS services
   - Private subnets for EC2 instances
   - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access

6. **Add Comprehensive Monitoring**
   ```hcl
   # Enable GuardDuty
   resource "aws_guardduty_detector" "main" {
     enable = true
   }
   
   # Enable Config
   resource "aws_config_configuration_recorder" "recorder" {
     name     = "security-recorder"
     role_arn = aws_iam_role.config.arn
   }
   ```

7. **Encrypt Everything**
   ```hcl
   # Encrypt EBS volumes
   root_block_device {
     encrypted = true
     kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.ebs.arn
   }
   
   # Encrypt CloudWatch logs
   resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "encrypted" {
     kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.logs.arn
   }
   ```

### Operational Security

8. **Implement Secrets Management**
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials
   - Use Parameter Store with SecureString for configuration
   - Rotate secrets automatically

9. **Add Backup and Disaster Recovery**
   - Automated EBS snapshots
   - Cross-region backup replication
   - RTO/RPO documentation

10. **Enable Compliance Monitoring**
    - AWS Config rules for security compliance
    - AWS Security Hub for centralized findings
    - Custom CloudWatch alarms for security events

## üîç Security Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Run `terraform plan` and review all security groups
- [ ] Validate no hardcoded credentials in any files
- [ ] Check all ingress rules are restricted appropriately
- [ ] Verify encryption is enabled for all data stores

### After Deployment
- [ ] Run AWS Security Hub assessment
- [ ] Perform vulnerability scan on EC2 instances
- [ ] Test SSH access restrictions
- [ ] Validate HTTPS is working properly
- [ ] Review CloudTrail logs for unusual activity

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Monthly security group reviews
- [ ] Quarterly access key rotation
- [ ] Regular vulnerability assessments
- [ ] Automated compliance checks

## üìû Incident Response Plan

In case of security incident:
1. **Isolate**: Remove affected instances from load balancer
2. **Investigate**: Check CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs
3. **Contain**: Update security groups to block suspicious traffic
4. **Recover**: Replace compromised instances
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security configurations
